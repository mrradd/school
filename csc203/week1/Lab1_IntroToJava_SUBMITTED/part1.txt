  Syntax error is when the programmer mistypes a statement making commands Java
cannot understand, it could also mean missing a semi-colon at the end of a line,
etc.

  Sytem.oat.pruntlm('hi').
  should be
  System.out.println("hi");

/******************************************************************************/
What is the importance of a variableâ€™s name, type, size and value?
/*****************/
  Name lets the program know how to call the variable.
  Type tells the program what data type it is so it can use the proper methods
  on it.
  Size tells the compiler how large the variable is. Generally dictated by
  Type.
  Value tells the program what the value is at the memory location.

/******************************************************************************/
What is an import declaration and where does it appear in a Java source code
file?
/*****************/
  The 'import' declaration tells Java what libs, runtimes, or namespaces that
  this particular section/class is going to use. It usually appears at the top
  of a .java file.
  
/******************************************************************************/
Why do programmers insert comments in their code?
/*****************/
  To document their code, or break up separate sections. Sometimes to comment
  out lines for testing/debugging.
