Locker Puzzle Analysis
20160703


Analysis:
The problem was intended to have us practice iterating over arrays using non-conventional iteration methodology.

Design:
The biggest challenge to solve this problem was designing an algorithm so I only needed one nested loop to get my data.

Testing:
I tested this program by making sure every iteration had the same output.
