* Pointers, References, and Multiple-file - 5 function Calculator
* The purpose of this project is to give you an opportunity to apply your
* knowledge of functions, pointers, and references in creating a multiple-file
* application.
* 
* 
* Pointers and References
* You must create a basic 5 function calculator similar to the assignment from
* week 2. However, this program will use pointers and references in the functions
* rather than passing by value. The functions which perform the actual
* calculations should have pointers as parameters, while the display function
* should use references as parameters.
* 
* 
* Multiple-file Application
* This program must be done as a multiple file application, with the
* appropriate source and header files. Make sure that your functions are
* properly prototyped, and that the definitions are in the proper location.
* 
* With this program all of the function prototypes will be stored in a separate
* header (.h) file, and all function definitions will be stored in a separate
* source (.cpp) file with the same name as the header (.h) file.
* 
* The primary source (.cpp) file will only contain the necessary pre-processor
* directives, the namespace declaration, and the definition of the "main()"
* function.
* 
* You must ensure that this program works at least the same as the week 2
* version.  Although, additional content may be added to improve the program.
* (just make sure that it at least meets the minimum requirements.
* 
* 
* For this project you must create a C++ project that will:
* $ Include separate functions to perform the following:
*     $ Prompt for user to enter a numeric value.  (this will be used twice.) 
*     $ Prompt for user to enter the type of calculation. ( + - * / )
*     $ perform the calculation. (one each for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
*       and division)
*     $ display the FULL results of the calculation. (see below for sample output.)
* $ This program also needs to include the ability to store, retrieve, and clear
* $ a value in memory.
* $ This program should use all double precision variables.
* $ All variables should be local to the functions they are needed in, and passed
* $ appropriately. (NO Globals!)
* $ The program should loop continuously until the user decides they are done.
*     $ Ask the user if they want to do another calculation.
*     $ This can also be done by running the entire program from a menu.
* $ The program should then pause and wait for the user to press a key before
* $ closing.
* 
* 
* The final output should show the complete calculation:
* Example:
* 12.4 + 5.32 = 17.72
* Or:
* 3.0 * 2.5 = 7.5
* 
* 
* Recommendations for extra points:
* $ Create one function which can do any of the four calculations;
* $ Have the function that asks for the type of calculation return a pointer, not
*   an actual character.
