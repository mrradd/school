/******************************************************************************
* You must create a simple body mass index (BMI) calculator. BMI is a
* measurement of the relative percentages of fat and muscle mass in the human
* body. The BMI is equal to the weight in kilograms, divided by the square of
* the height in meters: BMI = kg / (m*m)
* 
* For this project you must:
*   Create a C++ Project that will prompt the user for two values (a height in
*   inches, and a weight in pounds)
*   
*   Use cout to display prompts and results to the user.
*   
*   Prompt for user to enter height in inches
*    
*   Prompt for user to enter weight in pounds
*   
*   Use cin to store these inputs appropriately.
*   
*   Calculate the BMI from the user inputs
*   
*   Use cout to display results to the user.
*   
*   Display BMI to user.
*   
*   Thank them for using your program.
*   
*   Program should then pause and wait for the user to press a key before
*   closing.
