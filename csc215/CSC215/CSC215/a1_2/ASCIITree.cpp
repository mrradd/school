/******************************************************************************
* You must create a program that will display a christmas tree shape using the
* asterisk character. This program will prompt the user for a number of lines
* in the tree, then based on the user's input, it will use the asterisk
* character to display a christmas tree shape with that number of lines.
* Each line will contain an odd number of asterisks (1, 3, 5, 7, etc...)
* You will have to play with the number of spaces displayed on each line, to
* make the display correct.
* 
* For this project you must create a C++ project that will:
* $Ask the user for the number of lines in their christmas tree. 
* $Use cout to display the prompt to the user.
* $Prompt for user to enter number of lines
* $Use cin to store the input.
* $Using loops to cycle through, use cout to display the tree image to the screen.
* $Thank them for using your program.
* $Program should then pause and wait for the user to press a key before closing.
* 
* ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
* $Use different characters by asking the user to choose a character.
* $Use random number generation to generate a tree with a random number of lines. (Stay between 10 and 20)
* $Have the character chosen at random from all of the letters of the alphabet.
* $After the tree is displayed, ask the user if they would like to draw another tree.
*   if they answer 'Y' for yes the program will run again.
*   if they answer 'N' for no the program will exit.
