* Book Collection and File
* The purpose of this project is to give you an opportunity to apply your
* knowledge of vectors and File I-O in C++.
* 
* You must create a program that will use a vector to store a collection of
* books. This can be a collection of fiction books, or text books, etc… as long
* as all the books are related in some way.  The vector will also write the
* data out to a file that will be stored locally on your computer.
* 
* Make sure that any functions are properly prototyped, and that the prototypes
* and definitions are in the proper files and locations.
* 
* For this project you must create a C++ project that will:
* $ Create a vector called bookCollection
*   $ Should be a vector of string objects
*   $ Users will be prompted to type in the titles of the books
* $ Use the getLine() function rather than just "cin" to get the user input
* $ Provide a menu for the user to:
*   $ Add a book to the collection
*   $ Display the books currently in the collection
*   $ Remove a book from the collection
*   $ Stop adding books and store the data in an external file
* $ Use the “push_back()” function appropriately to add the books to the
*   collection
* $ Correctly use an iterator to move through and display the collection
* $ Correctly use an iterator for removing a specific book when necessary.
* $ Put the collection in alphabetic order before storing to the external file,
*   $ only after all titles are added and any desired titles have been removed
*   $ Should happen immediately before the file is written
* $ Ensure that the external file is open for writing
* $ Name the file appropriately within the programming
*   $ Do not have the user enter a file name
* $ After the collection has been written to the file, make sure the file is
*   correctly closed.
* $ Next, open the file for reading, and read the data into a new vector called
*   "displayCollection"
* $ Use this vector to display the list of books to the user
* $ Lastly the program should ask if the user would like to run the program
*   again
*   $ If they choose yes, ensure that both vectors are cleared out, and the
*     program starts over again
*   $ If they choose no, the program should then end
* $ Make sure that you use functions for each of the different menu options
*   $ Creating and displaying the menu itself
*   $ Adding a book to the list
*   $ Displaying the current list (Also used at the end of the program)
*   $ Removing a book from the list
*     $ This function will call the display function to show the list
*     $ Then it will ask the user which book they want to remove
* $ Also create functions for the following:
*   $ Writing the collection to the file
*   $ Clearing out the two vectors at the end of the program
*    (use a pointer for this)
* 
* Recommendations for extra points:
* $ Allow the user to remove a book from the list by typing a title.
* $ If it finds it, it will be removed
* $ If not, it will display "Sorry, Title not found."
