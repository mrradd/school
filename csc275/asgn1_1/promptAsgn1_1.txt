Create a base class of a character.  You need 2 attributes, methods to access
and update these attributes, 2 constructors, and a printInfo() method that
prints the attributes.  For the update of the attributes, one must have
verification (for example, health cannot be a negative number).

Next, create 2 classes that inherit from the character class.  (for example,
zombie and goblin).  Each class must have 2 additional attributes, methods to
access and update these attributes, 2 constructors, and a printInfo() method
that prints the attributes. The print method should use the character base
method.  One of the constructors should use the base class constructor to
set these values as well.

Next, you need to have an additional print method using polymorphism.  The
second print method would only print a subset of the attributes.  Use a boolean value as the parameter that determines which printInfo() method is called.

Finally, write a Main() program that creates instances of all 3 classes and
calls both print methods.
NOTE:  The executable file is REQUIRED.  See the file VS - generate an
executable file in Doc Sharing.

Extra credit (5 points)  - allow the user to enter all the values and give them
responses if the values are not valid.
