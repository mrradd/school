void doBoostCommonFactor()
In this method I used boost::math::gcd to calculate the GCD of two numbers.
I chose this, because I had to do something similar in a previous class.

void doBoostForEach()
BOOST_FOREACH was used to iterate over string objects in a string vector.
This method was used, because I've wanted to have foreach functionality in c++.
It's nice to know that I have that option with Boost.

doBoostLogTrivial()
This method used a simple log function to output a string to console by way of
BOOS_LOG_TRIVIAL. Having made log classes in the past, this is definitely easy
to use and impressive. I look forward to investigating the output to file
capabilities.

doBoostRandom()
This actually took a couple methods to use the ranom methods of boost::random.
First was declaring the generator 'boost::random::mt19937 rng;', then establishing 
a distribution 'boost::random::uniform_int_distribution<> thirty(1,30);', and finally
using the distribution handing it the generator 'thirty(rng);'. Random number
generation with boost seems tedious after looking at their documentation. I can see,
though, how it would be very handy if some serious RNG was needed.

doBoostRegex()
Using boost::regex::pattern was actually easier than using C#'s or Java's I was quite
surprised. Reading the documentation on it, Boost's regex capabilities are far more
robust than those of C# and Java as well.
